          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p style="padding-top: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem">
            The website <i>WindMills</i> is developed using plain HTML5/CSS and
            JavaScript with jQuery. Its strucutred with flexbox. CSS is used
            throughout to bring the website to life. Divs are mostly named as
            containers where style is given, some ID's have been used in order
            to make the JavaScript easier to maintain
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sidebars-container">
          <div>
            <h3>About the SVG</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem">
              The website contains two "artworks" replicating a wind mill. One
              of these artworks is created in <strong>Figma</strong> where it is
              then exported as an SVG file. In order to make this windmill come
              to life we can use a svg tag &lt;b&gt; to mark the three blades.
              Then we can use this container to apply a CSS animation where we
              use <i>keyframes</i> to make it rotate. Seeing as the center of
              the container wasnt in the circle of the windmill we have to
              translate the origin (change the location of origio) of the
              container to a new value. This new value was found by just
              manually adjusting each value until It looked correct.
            </p>

            <h3>Flexbox</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem">
              In order to style this page flexbox has been used throughout to
              give the website a structure that could work on any device and
              browser size. Flexbox dynamically adjusts space between elemnents
              depending on window size, giving the website appear to be the same
              no matter the device being used. For example this documentation
              page is divided into two sidebars. This is acheived by having a
              container div displaying flex box and then having the
              flex-direction be of a row, where we jusitify the content with
              space inbetween. With CSS Media queries this can be further
              improved by using various flex attrbiutes such as flex-wrap and
              flex-shrink on elements if the overflow the width or height of the
              device
              <br />
              <br />
              On the art side we use flexbox in a column fashion to center
              buttons and the artwork in the center and making them come below
              each other.
            </p>

            <h3>jQuery</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem">
              jQuery has been used to make javascript code more easily readable
              and taking up less space in the codeeditor (not memory). jQuery
              functions also return the same element that we applied a function,
              this inturn allows us to chain methods on top of each other making
              the code in a way functional (but not without sideeffects) and
              again more readable. A example of this is in plain JavaScript in
              order to select and grab an element from the DOM you need to write
              the following line document.querySelector(elementType) while in
              jQuery this can be done like this $(elementType).
              <br />
              <br />
              For example we can use the $() function to imperatively select
              HTML DOMs from the website and dynamically alter styling. This is
              done with the "show docs/show art" buttons where we hide/reveal
              the respective elements
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>About the Canvas</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem">
              The second of the artworks is the canvas. On the canvas we can
              draw lines and make it look like a figure or shape. This is done
              by three functions that draw lines at given coordinates. In order
              to make the canvas appear animated, we need to use an inbuilt
              function in JavaScripts window object, called
              requestAnimationFrame, when calling this function we can pass a
              callback function that calls itself and in this way we have an
              infinite animation loop, recursively we're iterating and updating
              the angle value for each of the three blades and doing this in 360
              degree fashion. the 6 different coordinates x1, y1, ... x3, y3
              where found by just adjusting the values and testing to check if
              the wind mill blades looked like they were almost perpendicular
            </p>
            <h3>Cross Browser Testing</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem">
              In order to test that the website works on multiple browser and by
              using their developer tools you can scale the page to any size and
              check if the website's style breaks for some sizes, this does not
              happen because the use of relative pixel values with
              <strong>rem</strong> on margins and paddings. Often times there
              are cases where you need to have unique CSS attributes depending
              on your browser, however no such CSS attributes where needed to
              style this website. With tools such as Cypress you can also test
              the content and structure of a website. It also does alot of other
              types of test such as Unit Test ect, but thats beyond this scope.

            <h3>Code sources</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem">
              I've been messing around with CSS and Canvas animations for quite
              some time, so there are really no code sources except my own that
              I've gotten my inspiration. I cant include my github cause it
              would give away my name..
